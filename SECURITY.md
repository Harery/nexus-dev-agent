- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability within 5 business days.
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation.
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days and other vulnerabilities within 90 days.

### Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure.
- We prefer to fully address vulnerabilities before any public disclosure.
- We will credit you in our security advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Measures

### Built-in Security Features

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All automated actions are restricted to VS Code process scope
- **Permission Controls**: Granular access control and role-based permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all automated actions
- **User Confirmation**: Required approval for high-impact operations
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive configuration data is encrypted at rest
- **Secure Communication**: All network communications use TLS 1.3

### Security Best Practices

When using Nexus Dev Agent:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep the agent updated to the latest version
3. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
4. **Secure Configuration**: Use strong passwords and enable MFA where available
5. **Network Security**: Use the agent only on trusted networks
6. **Backup Security**: Regularly backup and secure configuration files

### Compliance

Nexus Dev Agent is designed to meet various compliance requirements:

- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system (ISMS)
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation for EU data subjects
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (healthcare environments)

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

Our security model implements multiple layers of protection:

1. **Application Layer**: Code signing, input validation, secure communication
2. **Process Layer**: Sandboxing, privilege separation, resource limits
3. **Data Layer**: Encryption, access controls, data classification
4. **Access Layer**: Authentication, authorization, session management

### Threat Model

We protect against the following threat categories:

- **Unauthorized Access**: Malicious actors gaining system access
- **Code Injection**: Injection of malicious code through prompts
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Privilege Escalation**: Elevation of permissions beyond intended scope
- **Denial of Service**: Attacks that disrupt agent functionality

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems and preserve evidence
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of the incident
3. **Containment**: Implement measures to prevent further damage
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document findings and improve security measures
